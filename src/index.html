                Hexavalent is a private and secure browser based on existing
                security research. We're focused on hardening Chromium with a
                series of patches, some of which come directly from other
                security-oriented projects.

                <strong>Aimed at real people.</strong> We've invested in
                defenses for real threat models and won't accept security
                theatre. One of our objectives is to develop security while
                providing a good user experience, with hardening that
                <strong>doesn't get in the way.</strong>

            <p><strong>Features that work for you.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Site sandbox is strengthened by way of finer-grained
                    origin isolation, improving on the current eTLD+1 isolation
                    to mitigate real speculative execution exploits targeting
                    sites that aren't sufficiently cross-origin isolated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More private WebRTC IP handling policy by default and
                    provision of a toggle for users who may use a UDP-less proxy
                    and accidentally expose their ISP public address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Development of a developer-facing toggle for easily
                    disabling the creation of native code for JavaScript
                    just-in-time, a W ⊕ X violation and a major source of
                    vulnerabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Built with <code>-fstack-protector-strong</code> to expand
                    stack canaries to more functions while maintaining low
                    performance impact
                </li>
                <li>
                    Various security improvements to PartitionAlloc to make it
                    more resistant to heap corruption such as randomisation of
                    freelist entries on allocation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initialisation of all variables with zero to mitigate
                    vulnerabilities stemming from use of uninitialised memory
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stubbing of the Battery Status API to counteract abuse of an
                    API that has largely not been used for its intended purpose
                </li>
                <li>
                    Revoking of sensors access by default to avoid giving sites
                    unfettered access to sensitive info
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building with <code>-fwrapv</code> by default to wrap
                    otherwise undefined signed overflow
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enabling of all current state partitioning features present
                    upstream
                </li>
                <li>Making HTTPS-only mode the default</li>
